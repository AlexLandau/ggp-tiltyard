    <h1>About the Tiltyard Gaming Server</h1>
    
    <h2>General Game Playing</h2>
    <p>General game playing is a domain of artificial intelligence that studies
    computer systems that can play a wide variety of games. General game players
    can play games spanning the range from Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect Four to Checkers
    and Chess, without needing human programmers to devise game-specific strategies
    in advance.</p>
    
    <h2>Tiltyard Gaming Server</h2>
    <p>This server continuously runs matches between general game playing systems,
    allowing developers to easily test out their players. Currently it is specifically
    designed for use as part of the CS227b class at Stanford University, and the games
    are chosen to be simple enough for student players to handle without fancy
    infrastructure, but challenging enough to demonstrate intelligence on the part of
    the players and be interesting to watch.</p>
    
    <p>Games are loaded from the game repository server at <a href="http://games.ggp.org/">games.ggp.org</a>,
    which is available as a stand-alone resource to developers interested in building general
    game playing applications. Matches are published to the spectator server at matches.ggp.org,
    where they can be watched in real time, or queried and processed in bulk by researchers.</p>

    <h2>Joining the Server</h2>
    <p>Adding your player to the server is easy! Just log in using any OpenID account, go to the
    players page, and use the link at the top of the page to add your player to the server. Once
    you have registered your player, Tiltyard will automatically start matches between your player
    and other active players on the server.</p>
    
    <p>You are responsible for hosting your player: it must be connected to the Internet and
    available at a URL (which can be an IP address and port). Since matches are played continuously,
    you should run your player on a system that will be able to stay up for long periods of time
    (or you should make sure to disable your player when the system hosting it is shut down).</p>
    
    <h2>GGP Galaxy and Friends</h2>
    <p>This server is open source, and is part of a larger open source effort called
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ggp-galaxy/">GGP Galaxy</a> that seeks to build a
    federated web-based general game playing ecosystem. This server also draws on the
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ggp-base/">GGP Base</a> open source project, which
    provides a Java-based backend system for running general game playing matches.
    The frontend server for Tiltyard runs on Google App Engine.</p>
